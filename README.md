# SDLC Interview Questions for Freshers
## 1. What is SDLC?

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a well-defined procedure for producing high-quality, low-cost software in the shortest amount of time possible. The SDLC's purpose is to create exceptional software that exceeds all customer expectations and demands. The SDLC develops and describes a detailed plan that includes stages, or phases, each with its own process and deliverables. It describes the entire development process, including all tasks involved in planning, developing, testing, and distributing a software product.

## 2. What is the importance of the SDLC process?

Following are some of the points that briefly describes the importance of the SDLC process:

   - It explains why project planning, scheduling, and budgeting are necessary.
   - It allows for some control over the development process in order to guarantee that the final product meets the original criteria.
   - It provides a structure for a standard set of projects and deliverables.
   - It helps in the growth process by increasing the visibility of project planning to all involved parties.
   - It assures that the design and testing processes that lead to a solution's release are good and well-managed.
   - It is the most effective method for project management and tracking.
   - It aids in the acceleration of development and the improvement of client relationships.
   - It aids in the reduction of project risk and overhead in the project administration plan.

## 3. Explain the phases in a typical SDLC process briefly.
- Planning: The first stage of the SDLC is all about determining, what do clients want. Project planning is an important component of the software delivery lifecycle because it is here that the team estimates the cost and outlines the new program's needs.
- Gathering Requirements: Defining requirements is part of the planning process to figure out what the application is supposed to perform and what it needs. The development team examines the requirements while keeping the software's design and code in mind.
- Design: The following phase entails distilling all of the software project's requirements, analysis, and design information. This phase is the culmination of the previous two, such as customer feedback and requirement collecting. It is a simulation of how a software application will work. Some particulars of this phase are architecture, platform, security and user interface.
- Development: This is where the code is really written. Writing code is the first step in putting a design into action. Developers must adhere to the coding requirements set forth by their bosses. Many other jobs are included in the coding process. Many developers need to brush up on their abilities or collaborate with others. It's vital to find and resolve problems and flaws. If any changes or upgrades are needed, the developers can show the work to the business analysts.
- Testing: Before making an application available to users, it's vital to test it. The testing team examines the system's overall functionality. This phase aids with reducing the number of faults and issues seen by consumers. As a result, there is a higher level of user satisfaction and a higher rate of utilisation.
- Deployment: Once the product has been thoroughly tested and is ready for deployment, it is made available to customers. The deployment's complexity is determined by the project's size. Many businesses prefer to have the deployment step automated.
- Maintenance: The developed product is looked after throughout this period. The programme is updated on a regular basis to keep up with the changing user end environment or technology. Users find flaws that were not discovered during testing. These issues must be addressed, which may result in new development cycles

## 4. Explain the types of SDLC models.

Following are the predominant models that come under SDLC:

   - Waterfall model: The waterfall model is a prominent software engineering and product development approach that takes a linear, sequential approach to the software development life cycle (SDLC). The waterfall approach emphasises a logical step-by-step process. It was the first model in the software business to be extensively adopted. It is divided into phases, with one phase's output becoming the input for the next. [Learn More](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/waterfall-model-in-software-engineering/).
   - Agile model: Agile approaches divide jobs into smaller iterations or sections and avoid long-term planning entirely. The scope and requirements of the project are defined at the start of the development phase. The number of iterations, duration, and scope of each iteration are all clearly determined ahead of time. In the Agile process model, each iteration is a small-time "frame" that lasts anywhere from one to four weeks. [Learn More](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/agile-model/).
   - Iterative model: One of the most straightforward software development life cycle models is the iterative approach. There are several situations when the initial or basic software requirements are well-defined, but the project's complete scope or set of features is unclear. It primarily focuses on preliminary growth and design, then gradually develops momentum as more complex and needs are met until the final software is completely constructed. [Learn More](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/iterative-model/).
   - Spiral model: The spiral model is a risk management strategy that combines the iterative development process model with parts of the Waterfall approach. The spiral approach is preferred by software engineers for large, expensive, and complex projects. [Learn More](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/spiral-model/).
   - V-model model: The V-model is an SDLC paradigm in which processes are executed in a V-shape in a sequential manner. The Verification and Validation model is another name for it. The waterfall model is extended by the V-Model. Every phase of the development cycle has a testing phase that is directly linked to it. [Learn More](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/v-model/)

## 5. What is SRS?
A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a document that explains what the software will accomplish and how it will work. It is a formal report that serves as a representation of software and allows customers to assess whether it (SRS) meets their needs. It also outlines the functionality that the product must have in order to meet the needs of all stakeholders. This report is created after all requirements have been solicited and analysed, and it serves as a foundation for software engineering tasks.

## 6. What is a Feasibility Study?

As the name implies, a feasibility study is an analysis or measurement of a software product in terms of how advantageous product development will be for the business in terms of practicality. It determines whether the project is legally, technically, and commercially feasible.

## 7. What is the testing phase in the SDLC model
One of the most important procedures in the Software Development Lifecycle is testing (SDLC). It enables businesses to do a thorough evaluation of software and verify that their product meets the expectations of their customers. The testing procedures' main purpose is to report, monitor, troubleshoot, and retest software components until they meet the quality requirements established in the initial SRS. During the testing phase, there are numerous forms of testing, including quality assurance testing (QA), system integration testing (SIT), and user acceptability testing (UAT).

## 8. Which SDLC model is best and Why
According to the annual State of Agile report, Agile is the best SDLC methodology and also one of the most widely utilised SDLC in the IT industry. Unlike other predictive approaches, the adaptive agile methodology does not necessitate comprehensive preparation. If a change is required, it can be made during the sprint. It's ideal for projects that require a lot of customer involvement and projects that have a constantly changing environment.

## 9. What are the advantages of the SDLC process
At the end of each stage, a formal review is established to provide for maximum management oversight. SDLC aids in the creation of extensive system documentation. This guarantees that system needs can be linked to specified business goals. It generates a large number of intermediate products that may be evaluated to see if they fit the user's requirements and adhere to industry standards. These can be improved further if necessary, ensuring that the company receives exactly what it requires.

## 10. What are the disadvantages of the SDLC process
Before you begin, make sure you understand all of the details of the project. During the development phase, there was a lot of paperwork. It is difficult to alter or change due to a lack of flexibility. If the planning isn't done properly, the project will take longer and cost more. When there are a lot of flaws in the code, fixing them can take a long time and cause deadlines to be missed.

## 11. Explain HLD
It refers to the general design of the system. It describes the application's overall description and architecture. It includes a system architecture description, database design, a brief overview of systems, services, platforms, and module relationships. From the primary module to all submodules, it creates the overall architecture of the system. Architects will provide the High-Level Design in order to begin the development process. This is quite helpful for developers in comprehending the system's flow

## 12. Explain LLD
LLD (Low-LevelLevel Design) is a term that refers to the process of detailing. It provides a full description of each module, including actual logic for each system component and a thorough examination of each module's specifications. Every program undergoes logic design, which is subsequently recorded as program specifications. A unit test plan is prepared for each software. The micro-level or intricate design is another name for it. After the High-Level Design, the Low-Level Design is created.
